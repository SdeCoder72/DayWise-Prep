# Day 5 Reflection

## ‚úÖ What clicked:
- CSS Combinators made selector logic clearer
- Array rotation algorithm felt satisfying to dry-run

## üöß What needs polish:
- Still a little confused between inline and inline-block in responsive layout
- Want to do dry run of 3-tier DBMS with a web example

## ‚úçÔ∏è Next Steps:
- Build a CSS grid using combinators + Flexbox
- Solve "Left rotate" and "Right rotate" contest problems
- Sketch full DBMS architecture
