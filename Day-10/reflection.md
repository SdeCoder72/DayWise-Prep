# ðŸŒ± Day 10 Reflection

## âœ… What felt powerful:
- Building real JS projects with event logic
- Understanding how apps talk to the OS via system calls

## ðŸš§ What needs polish:
- Still reviewing event loop phases (microtasks vs macrotasks)
- Want to sketch syscall flow with Hindi annotations
