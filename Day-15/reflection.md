# Reflection - Day 15

## 🔍 What I Learned
- Java strings are powerful but need careful handling due to immutability.
- Practicing DSA string problems helped reinforce logic and edge case thinking.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Explore KMP and Rabin-Karp algorithms
- Build a mini Java app for string analysis
- Try solving string problems with recursion
