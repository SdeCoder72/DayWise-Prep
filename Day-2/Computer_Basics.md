## 🔧 Basic Parts of a Computer

- **Motherboard**: The main circuit board that connects and allows communication between all hardware components.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Often called the "brain" of the computer; it processes instructions and performs calculations.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary memory used to store data that is actively being used by programs for fast access.
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Long-term storage that uses spinning disks to store data magnetically.
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: A faster, more reliable storage device with no moving parts; used for high-speed data access.
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit)**: Converts electricity from your wall outlet into usable power for all internal components.
- **Expansion Cards**:
  - **Video Card**: Handles rendering of images and videos.
  - **Sound Card**: Controls audio input/output.
  - **Network Card**: Manages network connectivity (Ethernet/Wi-Fi).

## 🌐 Internet & ISP Tiers

### What is ISP?
An **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** is a company that delivers internet access to consumers and businesses via various technologies.

### 🔹 ISP Tiers

1. **Tier 1 – Global Backbone Providers**
   - Large companies like AT&T or Tata Communications.
   - Own international infrastructure.
   - Direct access to the entire internet with zero cost.

2. **Tier 2 – Regional/National Providers**
   - Purchase internet connectivity from Tier 1.
   - Deliver services within specific countries or regions (e.g. Airtel, Jio).

3. **Tier 3 – Local ISPs**
   - Buy bandwidth from Tier 2.
   - Focus on consumer-level services in small areas.

### 🔌 Types of Internet Connections
- **Fiber Optic**: Ultra-fast speeds using light signals.
- **Cable**: Shared bandwidth using TV cable lines.
- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**: Internet over telephone lines.
- **Dial-Up**: Slow speed, uses phone line for connection.
- **Satellite**: Used in remote locations; signal from orbiting satellites.
- **5G Home Internet**: Wireless internet using cell towers.
